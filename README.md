# Textio: DocDisplay Component

## How to use

Run these commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000

There are a few examples to browse (use the tree menu on the left), and you can put your own custom input in by using the "input text" field at the bottom of the window.

Run tests with
`npm test`

## What Is This

For this project, I used React Component Development Kit to get started:
https://github.com/storybooks/react-cdk

This gave me some boilerplate code to quickly start developing with features like unit testing and hot module reloading.

* Examples are located at ./src/stories/index.js
* Webpack config is located at ./storybook/webpack.config.js
